<h1>How should my background be?</h1>
The background is possibly where you get the most freedom. It can be any shape, color, stying and have patterns and effects.
The background as a rule, shouldnt be recolored unless you have spent some time getting to know the editor and feel confident you can do it and make it look good. 
<br>
Recall that a nice tip to naming the background specefically is to add _background or _bg <strong>at the very end</strong> of the filename. 
Then it will remain in the editor after pressing "purge top", so you can easily import more content for it.
<br>
For my token, my background and the token border are the same, however, if you wish to have may different borders and background dependign on mood or token type, simply separate these two layers!
<h4>I have a flat image where I would like to extract the background.</h4>
The goal is here to <strong>only</strong> exstract the background, so that you may use it for several diffrent tokens.
<ol>
    <li>Open your token in your preferred art or image editing software, the important part is that the software can work
        with diffrent layers.</li>
    <li>Grab the polygon tool and select around the item on the background, once you have done this, cut that item and forget about it.
        <ol type="i">
            <li>If to reversely wish to remove the background from an item, simply paste the item on a new layer, and delete the background layer.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You are now left with a hole in your background, depending on the complexity of the background you have, the next few steps may be a bit challenging.</li>
    <li>If you have a solid color background, whith little to no patterns, simply grab your ploygon tool again, select the background inside the token border, and color the selection, on a new layer, with the desired color using a large brush.</li>
    <li>If you have a heavily patterned background, try to find an image that resembles the pattern, then import it onto your background. Using the polygon select tool, select inside the token border of your background, inverse the selection (often this is with ctrl + i) and go yo the image layer. Press delete or use the eraser tool to remove excess image.</li>
    <li>Select your new layer on top of your original background, and enable alpha-lock.</li>
    <li>With an airbrush, make a vingette by selecting a darker than that of the image/background, and run the brush around the edge of the image. This may take a few tries.</li>
    <li>Finally, with an airbrush, size it just envelops your whole background. Select a lighter color than that of your image/background, and click once or twice, or untill you are happy.</li>
    <li>Merge all layers and export it as a transparent image. <strong>Remember</strong> to name it by the convention "exsample_background.extension" or "exsample_bg.extension".</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Always let your background be a bit boring, the focus should be on the content inside.</li>
    <li>Adding the viniette on the background makes it more visually appealing and directs the eyes to the center, where your wonderful content is!</li>
    <li>Expirament with borders, this is often where the theme of a campaign, game, item, or character can come through. For cyberpunk, consider adding wires sticking out, or for a druid, make the border resemple bent sticks.</li>
</ul>

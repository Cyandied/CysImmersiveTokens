<h1>How do I create tokens?</h1>
<h2>The layers</h2>
Its simple, relativly, it is all about the layers, and you'll need plenty.
To create a finished token like the one to the left, I needed 6 layers.
<ul>
    <li>lines and static colors</li>
    <li>alpha top</li>
    <li>alpha middle</li>
    <li>alpha bottom</li>
    <li>glow</li>
    <li>background</li>
</ul>

To see the separation, click the token, and it will split up like a burger.
I have made a few decesions here, for starters, i have decided to collect any static coloring (shadows, highlight,
other) in one layer with the line-art.
This is a way to control the amount of layers you are working with.
<span class = "br"></span>
I also decided to separate my two background elements, glow and background. This is so I can easily reuse the same
background for several different tokens.
<span class = "br"></span>
To learn more about how to format any of the layers, simply click it, and I'll tell you a bit more in deltail how you
should go about making them.
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
If you plan to use this service for a large amount of tokens, save yourself some pain and stick to a rigid naming
scheme, I reccomend:
<span class = "br"></span>
numberLetter_name_layertype_discription.extension
<span class = "br"></span>
The number in the front is representative of the overall layer the image will be placed on, I usually place token
backgrounds on layer 9, and token borders on layer 1, and then fill out everything in between.
<span class = "br"></span>
The letter after the number represents the position of the image within thier layer. I usually place all alphas on the
same layer (layer 5) so I will use A-Z to determine which alpha should be displayed on top.
<span class = "br"></span>
Here is how the layers of the stone on the left is named:
<ul>
    <li>2A_stone_smooth_static.png</li>
    <li>5A_stone_smooth_alpha_details.png</li>
    <li>5B_stone_smooth_alpha_stripes.png</li>
    <li>5C_stone_smooth_alpha_base.png</li>
    <li>8A_stone_smooth_glow.png</li>
    <li>9A_orange_bg.png</li>
</ul>
It is clear what is what, the order of the alpahs are nicely seprated via the alphabet (top A &rarr; Z bottom), and my
orange background, which I am planning to reuse many times,
is easily dicrnable so you dont accidentally purge it.
<span class = "br"></span>
As an extra help, make absolutely sure you name the background with the _background_ or _bg_ added in its filename (_bg and _background if it is at the end).
Then it will remain in the editor after pressing "purge top".
<span class = "br"></span>
When uploading images, if there does not exsist a file with the _bg or _background, all files will be forcebly set to
the same dimentions as the smallest image you have uploaded. In the case that you have uploaded a _bg or _background
image, all images will be sized after the smallest of those (if there happens to be more then one).
<span class = "br"></span>
<strong>If you have specefic dimentions for your token, you can input that in the "size" field in the editor, this will
    take priority over all other forced sizing I have implemented.</strong>
<span class = "br"></span>
It is very important that all images have the same size, else you will not be albe to download the image, that is why I
must implement stuff like this. I am currently looking into other methods for image manipulation with python, I am
currently using Pillow and it is quite slow, so this might change in the future.

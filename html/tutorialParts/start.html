<h1>How do I create tokens?</h1>
<h2>The layers</h2>
Its simple, relativly, it is all about the layers, and you'll need plenty.
To create a finished token like the one to the left, I needed 6 layers.
<ul>
    <li>lines and static colors</li>
    <li>alpha top</li>
    <li>alpha middle</li>
    <li>alpha bottom</li>
    <li>glow</li>
    <li>background</li>
</ul>

To see the separation, click the token, and it will split up like a burger.
I have made a few decesions here, for starters, i have decided to collect any static coloring (shadows, highlight, other) in one layer with the line-art.
This is a way to control the amount of layers you are working with.

I also decided to separate my two background elements, glow and background. This is so I can easily reuse the same background for several different tokens.
<br>
To learn more about how to format any of the layers, simply click it, and I'll tell you a bit more in deltail how you should go about making them.
<h2>Naming conventions</h2>
If you plan to use this service for a large amount of tokens, save yourself some pain and stick to a rigid naming scheme, I reccomend:
<ul>
    <li>example_lines_static.extention</li>
    <li>example_alpha_A.extention</li>
    <li>example_alpha_B.extention</li>
    <li>example_alpha_C.extention</li>
    <li>example_glow.extention</li>
    <li>basic_background.extention</li>
</ul>
It is clear what is what, the order of the alpahs are nicely seprated via the alphabet (top A &rarr; Z bottom), and my basic background, which I am planning to reuse many times, 
is easily dicrnable so you dont accidentally purge it.
<br>
As an extra help, make absolutely sure you name the background with the _background or _bg added on <strong>at the very end</strong> of its filename. 
Then it will remain in the editor after pressing "purge top".
<br>
When uploading images, <strong>ensure that they are the same size, all of them!</strong> Else the whole editor breaks...

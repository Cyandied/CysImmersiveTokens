<h1>So what is an alpha?</h1>
The alpha is the very heart of this whole oparation, it is <strong>the</strong> element that matters. It is what chnages
colors, thus making the token "immersive".
<h2>How do I make an alpha?</h2>
The alpha (or alphas if you so choose) is a transparent, most conviently uniformly colored, part. It lays just beneath
your lineart and shading (and possibly static colors, but that is not important now).
It is the part of the image you can change the color of, and needs to be marked in the editor as an alpha layer,
then the color picker will activate, and you can marvel at my costum made loading bar while waiting for the (at times)
lenthy process of replacing the color on your alpha.
<span class = "br"></span>
When replacing the color of your aplha, the editor will totally cover the original coloring, so any shading, highlight, texture, or pattern
<span class = "br"></span>
In your drawing program with will make your alpha with two methods, depending on if you have a premade flat token, or you
alreayd have a layer separated token.
<h4>I already have a flat image I want to "immersify", how do I separate the alpha(s)?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Open your token in your preferred art or image editing software, the important part is that the software can work
        with diffrent layers.</li>
    <li>Start by getting an overview of your token. What parts of the token do you want to be color changeing? What parts
        should remain static?</li>
    <li>Grab the polygon selection tool and go around the alpha you have decided to cut out, if you have several alphas
        you wish to stack, select the bottom most one first if it encompasses the rest.</li>
    <li>When you have selected your alpha, copy the selection, and paste it on a layer above.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process for every alpha you want.</li>
    <li>For best results, add a gaussian blur to the alpha layers, about 1 to 2 pixels, and duplicate them a few times
        (merging them after to get one layer per alpha).</li>
    <li>Save each layer as an image by itself, make it a transparent png or a webp. You will have some alphas and the
        original image.</li>
    <li>Upload the images to the editor, the alpahs should be on top of the original image. Choose colors to your heart's
        desire!</li>
</ol>
<h4>I have an image separated in layers, how do I separate the alpha(s)?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure that the parts you wish to be alpahs are on a layer, completely by themsleves.</li>
    <li>Save each layer as a seperate image, make it a transparent png or a webp. You will have some alphas, and some
        static graphics.</li>
    <li>Upload the images to the editor. If you need to you can take a screenshot of the layer separation in your image
        editing software, use this to reference when assinging a layer in the editor.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What is the difference?</h4>
The differece between these two methods vary by the complexity of the token you are trying to chnage the color of. For a
relativly simple token, like this flask I made, it is barely noticalbe:
<div class ="flex-row flex-center flex-top-flat">
    <div style="width: 40%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/flaskFlat.png" alt=""><strong>Flask where original image was flat.</strong></div>
    <div style="width: 40%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/flaskLayered.png" alt=""><strong>Flask where original image was layer seprated.</strong></div>
</div>
If we instead look at a more complex exsample, like the icon on the left, we get more noticalbe diffrences:
<div class ="flex-row flex-center flex-top-flat">
    <div style="width: 40%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/stoneFlat.png" alt=""><strong>Stone where original image was flat.</strong></div>
    <div style="width: 40%;"><img style="width: 100%;" src="images/stoneLayered.png" alt=""><strong>Stone where original image was layer seprated.</strong></div>
</div>
<span class = "br"></span>
Things get less precise, and the color flatten. If you dont think this is important, using a flat image is a lot faster than either manually sperating a flat image into layer and doing many neseccary reparations, or drawing the icon yourself.
<span class = "br"></span>
The secret 3rd option is buying my token pack, which has predefined setting for easy and fast token making! Girls gotta eat afterall!

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Never pick extremely dark or extremely light colors for your tokens, this often eats a lot of detail and focus.</li>
    <li>Similiarily, dont choose colors that are extremely saturated, this can burn the eyes of you and your players.</li>
    <li>Keeping the biggest alpha intact and not cutting other alpahs from it can allow you to use a multi-alpha token as a mono-alpha token, avoiding having to choose the same color multiple times by not importing the smaller alphas.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What <strong>is</strong> glow exactly?</h1>
Glow is just what i have decided to call it, here it is specefically the ligth ring that goes around the whole item in the token.
It makes it stand out agaisnt the background, and that is something I enjoy. 
It could also be used to add a shadow below your item, or perhaps make small changes to the background. 
Like if the item depicted is taken off a bloody corpse, this could be a blood splatter layer, or maybe you need the token for a campaign set in a cold enviroment and it can be sued to add ice to the background.

The possibilites are endless, it is, essensially, and effect layer.

Glow is of course, completely surpufilous and you don't need to include it.
But if you wish to, here is a little tutorial on how to add glow to your token.
<h4>I have a flat image I would like to add a glow layer to</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Open your token in your preferred art or image editing software, the important part is that the software can work
        with diffrent layers.</li>
    <li>Grab the polygon selector, and select around the item, leaving the background undisturbed.</li>
    <li>Copy the selection and paste it to a layer above, duplicate this layer, the bottom of these two layers is your glow layer.</li>
    <li>Enable aplha-lock for the glow-layer, and paint over it, using a big paint brush, in the desired color. If the color is lighter than the background, it will result in a glow, if it is darker, it will be a shadow.
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Tip to select the color for your glow/shadow layer. Select the color of your backgroud and make it either lighter (while making the color more yellow) or darker (while making the color more blue).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Disable alpha-lock on your glow-layer, and add a gaussian-blur filter, set this to however much you like. Personlly I stick around 10 or 15.</li>
    <li>Save every layer as a seperate transparent image, and import into the editor.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using the editor to change the color of your glow-layer</h3>
The editor is perfectly capable of this, simply set the glow-layer as an alpha layer and select a new color. Opacity is retained during the recoloring process, 
so it will still have the faded look it had initally.

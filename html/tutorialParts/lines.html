<h1>Lines and static colors, how should they work?</h1>
Depending on the style of your token, lots of things can be in here. For my style, I use thick lines and simple cell-shading.
The shading is simply a dark color (blueish black) set to about 20% opacity, while the highlights are a ligth color (yellowish white) set to the same opacity.
I merge these with my strong highlights and lines to get a simple foreground that is only one layer thick.

In here, I also put what I would like to call static colors. Colors that you don't want to change, this could be the stem of a flower, cork of the bottle, or handle of a sword.
<h4>I have a flat image I would like to add lines, shading and/or static colors too</h4>
This is quite a mouthfull, and often more trouble than it is worth. Either accept that shading will be lost to the color-changer, or do some pretty heavy work to more or less trace the exsisting token (in which case you should be careful if the orignal image does not belong to you).
I wont do a totorial for it here, it would simply get too long and complex, and depending on the style of your token, completely unsuable. 
If you want lines and static colors to be seprated nicely, consider throwing some pocket money my way and buy my costum token pack!
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For optimal compatability with a wide range of colors, make your lines pure black.</li>
    <li>Using pure white and pure black as shading and highlighting can steal vibrance from the colors below, make them a bit blue or yellow.</li>

    <div data-id="image-uploader" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>image upload input</h4>
        This is where you begin, press this to select all images you wish to import into the editor and work with.
        Dont worry if you forget something, you can import images several times during the editing process.
    </div>
    <div data-id="upload-images-button" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>upload images button</h4>
        When you press this, your selected images will be imported into the editor, beware, this will also reset all
        images currently in the editor.
        This is done to keep the editor neat and as small as possible, I only have so much server space :/
    </div>
    <div data-id="purge" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>purge all images</h4>
        This button will permanently remove all images from the editor, please press this button before leaving the
        editor and beware that the entire site will burge itself once a week on sunday CET 00:00:00, so make sure to
        save any projects before then.
        There will also be a live countdown on the home page when we are within 24 hours of the purge.
    </div>
    <div data-id="purge-top" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>purge top images</h4>
        This button will purge all images that <strong>do not</strong> end with _bg or _background in thier filename,
        use this to easily start working on a new token while keeping the background elements loaded.
    </div>
    <div data-id="download" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>download button</h4>
        This button will automatically combine all images and promt you with a download. Make sure you have automatic
        download turned off in your browser.
        As a standard, the token will be named "your-token.png" so you can always find it on your pc.
    </div>
    <div data-id="filenames" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>your filenames</h4>
        This column displays the names of the files you uploaded, so it is up to you to ensure that you can easily
        diffirentiate them.
        If you need help, cosult my personal naming guide outlined at the start screen, press "back to start" at the top
        to go back to that page.
        <br>
        Pressing the del button removed that specefic file, and leaves the rest intact.
    </div>
    <div data-id="layers" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>layers</h4>
        This column displays the layers as radio buttons, there will always be as many layers as there are images, so if
        you uplaod a looot of images, this may get a tad messy.
        The layers are ordered so that the left most radio button represents the bottom layer, and the right most button
        represents the top layer.
        Two images can be on the same layer, in wich case it is the raw HTML positioning that decides which is on top
        and I cannot guarentee that the downloaded image will be the same as the one displayed.
        So it is my reccomendation that two images do not share a layer.
        <br>
        To make layering easier for you, by making it almost automatic, stick a number or a letter at the very beginning
        of the filename, where 1,a is the very top layer.
        Then the editor will automatically sort your layers in the correct order.
    </div>
    <div data-id="is-alpha" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>is the layer an alpha</h4>
        This is where you check off wather your layer is an alpha (meaning you wish the change its color) or not, if
        this field is not ticked, the color-picker for that layer will be disabled.
    </div>
    <div data-id="color-picker" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>color-picker</h4>
        This is where you pick your color for your alpha layer, the field will <strong>only</strong> be active if the
        associated layer is marked as an alpha layer.
        This is just the standard HTML color-picker, possibly more to come here...
    </div>
    <div data-id="your-token" class="display hide hidden">
        <h4>your token</h4>
        This is where your gorgeous token will be displayed! Sometimes this display with lag behind a tag if your token
        has a very high resolution, generally, everything will take longer if your token has a high resolution, but that
        will just give you all the more time to admire my costum made laoding bar that I made myself!.

<h2>tips, tricks, and despretate pleas from a small developer</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Please</strong> make sure to press purge after you have finished using the editor, I fully rely on you
        to keep your own lille space on my server clean and neat untill I find a good automatic cleaning method!</li>
    <li>When using the editor, reloading the page can result in weird artifacts (in the form of extra, weirdly named, layers) from the re-coloring process, to get rid
        of them, just delete them, it wont break anything.</li>
</ol>
